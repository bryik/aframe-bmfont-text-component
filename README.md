**This is an old component!** A-Frame 0.5.0 and up includes SDF text as [a standard component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/components/text.html). Use that instead!

## aframe-bmfont-text-component

**Works with A-Frame version 0.3.0.**

This component is useful for rendering bitmap and signed distance field font text in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io). Basically, it wraps Matt DesLauriers' [three-bmfont-text](https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text) and [load-bmfont](https://github.com/Jam3/load-bmfont).

Explanation of 'mode' property [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/word-wrapper).

## Usage

Write some text:

```html
<a-entity bmfont-text="text: Hello World;"></a-entity>
```

To change the size of the text, use the [scale](https://aframe.io/docs/0.2.0/components/scale.html) component or position the text closer or further away.

Text can be wrapped by specifying width, but I'm not sure what units three-bmfont-text uses. You will have to play around a bit.

## Custom Fonts

A guide for generating SDF fonts can be found [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Distance-field-fonts); here is an example comparing [Arial Black and DejaVu](http://i.imgur.com/iWtXHm5.png). Bitmap fonts also work, but do not look nearly as good.

Different fonts can be specified with the 'fnt' and 'fntImage' properties.

```html
<a-entity bmfont-text="text: Hello World; fnt:../fonts/DejaVu-sdf.fnt; fntImage:../fonts/DejaVu-sdf.png">
</a-entity>
```

Thanks to [RawGit](http://rawgit.com/), these default to hosted "DejaVu-sdf.fnt" and "DejaVu-sdf.png" files.

## Limitations

This component does not make use of all of the features of [three-bmfont-text](https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text) and its sister modules, if you require more advanced functionality such as tabSize and start and end indices, I recommend forking this component and modifying it. Pull requests are welcome, but please include a test example.

Bitmap font rendering limits you to the characters included in the font (Unicode this is not). SDF font (in particular) tends to smooth sharp edges though [there are ways around this](https://lambdacube3d.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/playing-around-with-font-rendering/).

#### Additional Information

If you are interested in text rendering in WebGL/ThreeJS/A-Frame and want to learn more, I recommend reading the documentation for [three-bmfont-text](https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text).
